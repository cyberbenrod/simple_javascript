/><p>LibX is an open source tool that can be used for your library.  There are editions for both small libraries as well as larger libraries.  
It is especially poplular in university libraries.  Some of the universities that use LibX are as follows:
 	University of Connecticut; Harvard University; New York University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Emory College; 
	Virginia Institute of Technology;
	Georgia Institute of Technology; University of Michigan; Duke University; Dartmouth College; Cornell Labs; Wyoming Libraries;
	Boston College; Brown University; 
	Columbia University; (Columbia University also uses the College Edition); University of Leicester (Great Britain); 
	University of Texas; University of Manitoba (Canada);
	Kansas State; Wester Libraries, the University of Western Ontario (Canada); and the University of Maine.  This is a partial list of satisfied LibX for 
	library users.
 </p>

  LibX is an Open Source tool. According the the Free Software Foundation, ..."the term 'open source' software is used
  by some people to mean more or less the same category as free software. It is not exactly the same class of software: they 
  accept some licenses that we consider too restrictive, and there are free software licenses they have not accepted. 
  However, the differences in extension of the category are small: nearly all free software is open source, and nearly all open 
  source software is free".

   <p>According the the staff at the Highline Community College Library, "it's a nice way of quickly searching our catalog without having to open a new window
  and go to the library homepage.  It also embeds our college logo as a cue into Amazon, Google, NY Times Book Review, ans some more sites so that you can 
  just click on our logo and instantly search the catalog.  Pretty cool." <a href="http://flightline.highline.edu/reference/"> Highline Community College Library</a></p>
